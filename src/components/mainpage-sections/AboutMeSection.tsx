const content = `## Hi, I'm Gavin \n
Thanks for stopping by! 

I'm a Datascientist and Programmer, currenty working at [Andromeda Medical Imaging](https://andromedamedicalimaging.com) as a Technical Lead.

I mostly work as a software developer and a datascientist, but I am also working on my own [indie game](projects), which consumes most of my spare time.

I like to make music, play video games, and rock climb (I know, sooo original).

## What is this site?

Before I made this site, I had so many different interests and experiences, but no where to share and store them all in an organized fashion. This page is really just a glorified list of links that connect all my various activities.\n

I also figure this is a great place for me to experiment with new technologies, and show my love for design, so expect this site to change a lot over time.
