# About gavinlau.ca
If you're here, it's because you were poking around on my personal site. 

I wanted to explore using Next.js to set up an all-in-one online access point that would have blogs, public notes, projects and also my resume.

Check out the [main page](https://www.gavinlau.ca) for up to date details!

## Site details
The site is hosted for free on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com). I'm using a NEXT.js framework and [Chakra UI](https://www.chakra-ui.com) for front-end stuff.
