I was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta and did my <Link variant={'inline'}

as={NextLink} href="#education">Bachelor of Science majoring in Neuroscience</Link> at the University of Calgary.

<br />

<br />

In 2019, I moved to Hong Kong to attend med school at the University of Hong Kong. I fell in love with the city. The balance of the vibrant urban centers against the secluded beaches and jungle just a bus ride away easily convinced me Hong Kong was my home.

<br />

<br />

Sadly, it did not last.

I envy you if you don&#39;t know what happened in the next three years ðŸ˜·, but I made the tough decision to leave Hong Kong and medicine in January 2022.

<br />

<br />

This ended up being the perfect opportunity for me to pursue programming and data science, a passion of mine that I always relegated to the backburner.

Currently, I am finishing up my <Link variant={'inline'} as={NextLink} href="#education">Master of Data Science and Analytics</Link> at the University of Calgary. I&#39;m excited for whatever opportunities present themselves next.

<br />

<br />

I&#39;ve always had a strong interest in video game developement, science and design. Recently, my interest in video games has led me to focus heavily on applying the principles of interactivity, engagment and design to data science and programming.

<br />

<br />

I would describe myself as creative and curious, but above all, I pride myself on being personable and adaptable.
